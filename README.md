# [CUNYPrime](http://cunyprime.herokuapp.com)

Retrieves CUNYFirst class schedules dynamically (undergraduate only) and builds alternate weekly schedules based on preferred times. 
Additional course information (eg. description, requirements, credits) is available for some schools.

### Schedule

* Search types:
  * Time-focused: search for classes that meet during the selected times
  * Requirement-focused: search for required courses. 
  * Advanced: Run a search with user-set parameters. 

  **WARNING:** CUNYFirst requires that the returned sections number <= 350. 
  Failing to meet that prevents CUNYPrime from retrieving the results and is something we have no control over, 
  so set parameters accordingly.

* Create a schedule:
  * OK - mark selected block as open/preferred
  * NO  - mark selected block as closed
  * CLEAR - clear the selected block
